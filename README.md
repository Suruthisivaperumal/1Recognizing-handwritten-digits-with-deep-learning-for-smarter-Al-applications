# Recognizing Handwritten Digits with Deep Learning for Smarter AI Application

This project presents a deep learning approach for recognizing handwritten digits using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It serves as a foundational AI application for systems that require digit recognition, such as form readers, postal code scanners, and smart calculators.

## Project Goals

- Train a neural network to classify handwritten digits (0â€“9).
- Achieve high accuracy using the MNIST dataset.
- Provide an easy-to-use script for prediction.
- Build a scalable model for integration in broader AI systems.

## Dataset

The [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) is used, containing:
- 60,000 training images
- 10,000 test images
- Grayscale, 28x28 pixel resolution

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/handwritten-digit-recognition.git
   cd handwritten-digit-recognition
